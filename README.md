# Simple TCP Chat

A simple TCP chat server, and client, written in Java. 

This project uses socket concepts, to transfer basic encoded Unicode characters across a local network, to chat! This was created to practice Java coding while implementing networking basics.

<em> IDE used: Eclipse.</em>

**TBD:**

- Fix code to allow server and client to be used on public internet.
- Eventually, this project with be deployed in a full environment, within my network. 
- Screenshots of the functional project will be added to this README.
